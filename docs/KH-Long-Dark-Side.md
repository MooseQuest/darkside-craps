# KH Long Play Don’t Strategy

## Bankrolls Supported:
- $1,000
- $2,000

## Gain / Loss:
- 20% / 50%

## Objective:
To play as long as possible.

## Description:
You are betting Don’t Pass and Don’t Come until you establish four points including the Don’t Pass bet. You will lay odds based on the number. The odds for $1,000 are structured so you can play as long as possible and closest to the house edge for your duration of play. The odds for $2,000 were designed by a Vegas Dealer to pay out $100 per point when a 7 is rolled.

### Setup for $1,000:

#### Point Off
- Place $25 on the Don’t Pass

#### ^1A Point Established:
- If point is 4 or 10, Lay $90 Odds
- If point is 5 or 9, Lay $60 Odds
- If point is 6 or 8, Lay $30 Odds
- See (1B)

#### ^1B Less than Four Points Established:
- Place a $25 Don’t Come

#### ^2A Second Point Established:
- See (1A)

#### ^3A Fourth Point Established:
- See (1A)

#### Breaks in Pattern:
- If a point is hit, count one strike and repeat (1A). If a point is hit three times, stop all betting until a 7 is rolled. At that point, analyze your bankroll to determine your risk. If you are at a 50% loss, walk away.
- If 7/11 is rolled immediately on the come out roll, replace your Don’t Pass Bet.

### Betting & Lay Odds for $2,000
- $50 Don’t Pass / Don’t Come
- 4 and 10: $100
- 5 and 9: $75
- 6 and 8: $60

### Modifiers
- If you would like to hedge more (lowers your chance of winning more) on the come out roll, you can place $25 on 7 and $10 on 11 (YO). This will protect you (outside a 12) on the come out roll. This modifier has been tested and severely stifles the ability to win but greatly reduces the chance of losing on the come out roll.
- If you encounter a situation where you missed a DC bet, you can lay $300 and pay Vig on the number that was just rolled. ($7 on 4/10, $10 on 5/9, $12 on 6/8). If a 7 is not rolled immediately after the bet is placed, take the bet down. This is using the idea that it is not likely to roll the same number twice and carries risk but makes up for your missed DC Play.
